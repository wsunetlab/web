  For details about the makeup of the lab itself, please visit the
  <a href="index.php">main moteLab page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The MoteWeb interface was conceived by 
  <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw">Matt Welsh</a> and
  <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~werner">Geoffrey Werner-Allen</a>. 
  The interface is implemented using 
  <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>
  and Javascript.  It uses 
  <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> as its backend database.
</p>
<p>
  The implementation of MoteWeb was considerably simplified by the use of
  authentication and database PHP modules provided by
  <a href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The MoteWeb interface is currently deployed at 
  <a href="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>.
  However, the developers are confident that it can easily be deployed at
  other institutions.  Questions about obtaining access to the source code
  for the web interface should be directed to 
  <a href="mailto:<?= $_MOTELABADMINADDRESS?>">The MoteLab administrators</a>.

  gwa would also like to thank many early MoteLab users who have been patient
  in the face of frequent problems.  The entire CS263 class was helpful and
  patient while doing a course assignment on the lab, but users DM, PZ, and
  BD receive special points for helping push MoteLab along.
